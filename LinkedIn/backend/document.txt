Express JS
what Express.js does in the MERN stack:

Acts as a server-side framework: It handles HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and routes.

Connects to the database: It communicates with MongoDB (often via Mongoose) to perform operations like create, read, update, delete (CRUD).

Handles APIs: Express lets you define APIs (routes) that your React frontend can call.

Built on Node.js: Express simplifies Node.js by providing an easier and cleaner way to manage routes and middleware.

Instalation
1. npm init -y
2. npm i express nodemon mongoose
3. npm i dotenv
4. npm i cors: It is a third party middleware that is used to overlap port and help to run the project.
